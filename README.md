**Py**thon A**l**most P**e**riodic S**a**m**p**ling Algorithms

This library contains a set of functions that have been used to 
1. Demonstrate the need of properly choosing the time samples before launching an harmonic balance computation
2. Highlight the benefits of an optimization algorihtm to choose such samples
