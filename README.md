**Py**thon A**l**most P**e**riodic S**a**m**p**ling Algorithms

This library has been build to allow reproducible research. 
In fact, it contains a set of functions that have been used to 

1. Demonstrate the need for properly choosing the time samples before launching an harmonic balance computation
2. Highlight the benefits of an optimization algorihtm to choose such samples

This piece of work has been published in Journal of Computational Physics : http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2012.11.010

## Getting Started

This library is meant to be standalone if you launch each example from it's own repository.
The scripts using this module are given under **applications** folder.
See the README file of each sub-folder for further information.
